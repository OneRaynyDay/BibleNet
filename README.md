# BibleNet

## Project for 170A, ACM AI, and for fun.

The point of this RNN project is to see how well different languages portray the bible. Would the Chinese generated bible make more sense than the English one? Which phrases would the English one pick out to be characteristic of the Bible? What about the spanish one?

Note: I'm not Christian and am not affiliated with any Christian organizations. This is purely for fun and because the Bible is easily one of the biggest word corpus available for free in different languages.
